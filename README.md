### Systems Architect & Interface Design

"Engineering high-performance digital cockpits for complex operational environments."

I am a **Systems Architect** focused on the intersection of **Technical Logistics** and **Modern Interface Design**. Drawing from a background in **Military Operations (Green Beret)** and **Industrial Engineering (ThermoKing)**, I build high-fidelity "Command Centers" that simplify complex data into actionable intelligence.

### 🎯 The Vision: "Precision Control"
I specialize in **Operational Orchestration**. My mission is to reduce the "Cognitive Load" on operators by building interfaces that feel like high-performance machinery.

- **Tactile Interface Design:** Developing a signature library of 3D/Mechanical React components designed for high-stakes environments where clarity and precision are non-negotiable.
- **State Orchestration:** Implementing robust logic flows (Zustand + LangGraph) to ensure that complex system data and user interfaces remain in perfect synchronization.
- **Industrial Aesthetics:** Applying "Supercar-Inspired" design principles to enterprise software to increase user engagement and reduce operational errors.
- **🚀 Current R&D:** The **Operational Command Center** — I am currently developing a standardized framework for "Operational Cockpits"—interfaces designed for real-time monitoring and decision-making in technical industries.

### 🛠️ The Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Framer Motion (Skeuomorphic & 3D UI)
- **Logic & State:** Zustand, LangGraph.js, Logic-Flow Mapping
- **Backend & Data:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Realtime), Edge Computing
- **Design Philosophy:** "Composite, Don't Paint" — GPU-optimized rendering for industrial-grade performance.

### 🇪🇸 The Mission: AramLabs Academy
I am currently developing **WasteWatcher**, an AI-powered waste reduction platform. My long-term goal is to establish the **AramLabs Academy in Fuengirola, Spain**, providing free, high-level education in AI Agentic Orchestration and Modern Web Development to empower the next generation of Spanish engineers.
