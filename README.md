### Aspiring Systems Architect & Interface Design Student

"Engineering high-performance digital cockpits for complex operational environments."

I'm a **52-year-old career changer** on a mission to become the most skilled AI engineer on the Costa del Sol. With a background in **Military Operations (Green Beret)** and **Industrial Engineering (ThermoKing)**, I bring discipline and systems thinking to my new path in tech.

One year ago, I started learning to code. Today, I'm a dedicated **student** building production-ready web applications and diving deep into AI engineering. I'm not a professional yet—just someone obsessed with mastering this craft.

### 🎯 The Journey: From Vibe Coder to AI Engineer

**Current Focus:**
- 🤖 **Agentic AI Development** — Learning to build real AI agents using Python, LangGraph, and modern LLMs (Claude, Kimi 2.5)
- 🎨 **Mechanical UI/UX** — Crafting tactile, high-performance interfaces that feel like precision machinery
- 🐍 **Python Mastery** — Expanding beyond frontend into full-stack AI engineering

**Learning Tools:**
- Cursor, Claude, Kimi 2.5, VS Code
- Open-source frameworks and hands-on project building

### 🚀 Current Focus: Building in Private

I'm currently working on **WasteWatcher** — an AI-powered waste reduction platform — as a private learning project. Once I've solidified my skills, I plan to release public repositories showcasing my work in agentic AI and industrial UI design.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack (Always Expanding)

| Frontend | AI/Backend | Design Philosophy |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript | Python, LangGraph, LangChain | "Composite, Don't Paint" |
| Framer Motion, 3D UI | Supabase, PostgreSQL | GPU-optimized rendering |
| Zustand, State Management | Edge Computing, Realtime | Industrial aesthetics |

### 🎓 The Dream: AramLabs Academy

Long-term vision: Establish **AramLabs Academy in Fuengirola, Spain** — a free, high-level school for AI Agentic Orchestration and Modern Web Development.

I want to empower the next generation of Spanish engineers, especially career-changers like myself who thought it was "too late" to start.

### 📝 A Note on Where I Am

I'm not an AI engineer yet. I'm a **student**. A serious one. I share my work to learn, connect, and document the journey from zero to mastery at 52.

If you're on a similar path—or further ahead and willing to share wisdom—I'd love to connect.
