# 🛡️ AramLabs Studio | Engineering Intelligence

### "We don't build interfaces. We build Operational Cockpits."

I am a Full-Stack Software Architect with a background in high-pressure technical operations and military discipline. I specialize in transforming complex business pain points into high-performance, production-grade AI applications.

## 💎 The AramLabs Signature
My work is defined by the **"Supercar-Luxury" UI/UX standard**:
- **Machined Precision:** Interfaces designed for speed, clarity, and zero-latency decision making.
- **Operational Intelligence:** Deep AI integration (Gemini Pro, LangGraph) focused on ROI, not hype.
- **Production-Grade:** Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase for scale and security.
